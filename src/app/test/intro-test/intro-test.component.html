                    The HSK score report serves as an important proof of test-takers’ Chinese proficiency. In view that some test takers may fail to carefully check the information as required during their registration online or at the test center or fail to carefully check
                    the registration confirmation or the test admission ticket after the completion of the test registration, which may lead to a discrepancy between the personal information on the score report and the real information, the Chinese testing
                    service website (www.chinesetest.cn), in order to ensure the normal use of the report, allows test takers to apply for the modification of the score report.
